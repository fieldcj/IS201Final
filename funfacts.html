    <p>Now, you might be wondering what a very interesting page this must be. How does it relate to Colby Field?<br>
    Well, the reason is, food is one of my most favorite things ever. And this page will give you a couple of fun facts about food such as the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="#glo"></a>The globalization of types of food</li>
        <li><a href="#var"></a>The variety of types of food</li>
        <li><a href="#soc"></a>The social aspects involving different types of food</li>
    </ol>
    <p> So, stay tuned and read down below to learn a little bit more about food presented through interactive graphs, Youtube videos, and personal photos!</p>
    <h2 id="glo" class="underline">Food on a global scale</h2>
        <p>Food is everywhere. It is all around us and always on our mind. Whether we recognize it or not, we all have an internal timer to alert us when it is time to eat again. So, humans have adapted and made different kinds of food (which we will talk about more later on).</p>
        <p>But humans don't hog their food to themselves, or at least not anymore. Food is now part of the global economy! You can go just about anywhere and eat food from just about anywhere! A huge thanks to that is the commercialization of food through restaurants and fast food.</p>
        <p>Below, we have an intereactive graph that shows one of the types of food that is global: McDonalds.This restaurant is probably one of the most well-known fast food restaurants, if not the most well-known. Looking at the graph below, we can see when hovering over the circles just how many restaurants of this chain are present in each country.</p>
        <div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1702576473796' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Number of McDonald&#39;s restaurants by country, end of year shownClick a country in the map to view details below ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Mc&#47;McDonaldsmapped&#47;McDonaldsrestaurants&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='McDonaldsmapped&#47;McDonaldsrestaurants' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Mc&#47;McDonaldsmapped&#47;McDonaldsrestaurants&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1702576473796');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='460px';vizElement.style.height='627px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>
        <p>Crazy, huh? McDonalds, like many other food chains, are all over the world bringing the greatness of a simple hamburger, pasta, or plate to everyone in the world.</p>

    <h2 id="var" class="underline">The varieties of food</h2>
        <p>As previously mentioned, there are many different types of food out there! Just think about rice for an example. There is white rice, brown rice, rice mixed with vegetables, rice in other plates, and many more! Such a simple food has been experimented with and adapted to fit into just about any plate one might eat.</p>
        <p>And that is the glorious part about food! It can be used in many ways and forms. Below is attached a video of one of my most favorite types of foods called arepas con queso. This food is very common to eat in Colombia and Venezuela.</p>
        <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GxCLudeJLHg?si=_SZcbX3LDbNzddue" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
        <p>The fun part is that even the arepa, a seemingly simple food, can be modified and changed for the liking! Some common things to put inside an arepa are:
        <ol>
            <ul>
                <li>rice</li>
                <li>eggs</li>
                <li>cheese</li>
                <li>meat</li>
            </ul>
        </ol></p>
        <p>Arepas, and every type of food, can be changed and adapted for any person, situation, or group! How awesome is that?</p>

    <h2 id="soc" class="underline">Food and it's impact socially</h2>
            <p><div><img src="../startbootstrap-clean-blog-gh-pages/assets/img/food.jpg" alt="My family eating together happily" height="300" class="box" class="media"></div><br>
            Nothing brings the family together quite like food!</p>
            <p>As you can see in the photo above, that is me along with my family enjoying a nice meal in Rome, Italy. One of our most favorite parts of the trip was trying the new kinds of foods with each other! And we sure did try many different kinds of food.</p>
            <p>Food is a huge social activity. Want to go on a date? Go to dinner. Want to ohang out with friends? Have lunch. After an early morning run with friends? Breakfast. Watching a movie with your family? Snacks.</p>
            <p>Of course there doesn't have to be a type of food present to have a great time with loved ones, but it sure makes a great time even better.</p>
